            Tips to Get the Best Results When You Edit Images with Nano Banana
          </h3>
          <ul class="text-gray-600 mb-4 list-disc pl-6">
            <li>
              Start with good source images. The better your starting photo, the
              more Nano Banana can enhance without having to “force” fixes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Use subtle adjustments. Big jumps in brightness or contrast often
              look unnatural. Small tweaks lead to more polished results.
            </li>
            <li>
              Experiment with filters. After you edit images with Nano Banana,
              test different styles. You might discover a look that brings your
              brand or personal aesthetic to life.
            </li>
            <li>
              Zoom in when retouching. Small details like blemishes or stray
              elements can be easier to adjust up close.
            </li>
            <li>
              Save a draft first. Before applying bold changes, keep a backup.
              That way, you can compare and revert if needed.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3 class="text-xl font-medium mb-3">Stories from Everyday Users</h3>

          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
